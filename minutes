October 4th, 2017

Aaron: Hey Heather! I have a question for you üôÇ I am doing a client project for school, and I was wondering if you wanted to be my client! I was wondering if you might be interested in having a website made for your crafts and stuff! I could even work on making a little online shop for you that you could use to accept payments / do shipping and things of that nature. I'm not sure how far you want to go with your stuff or if it was just a one off, but it seems like people really like your stuff. I even saw Rose N Crantz Coffee Co. posting on your page üôÇ, and someone else requesting an order!
Let me know how that might sound to you. üôÇ

Heather: Sure! I'm not exactly sure how far I want to go with it either, but I've actually had a few orders since the con - in fact, I've sold more since the event than I did AT the event - so it would certainly not be a bad idea. Ideally, somewhere with free web hosting would be my preference.. since it's only just BARELY a real store and probably not turning much of a profit, we'd have to keep expenses super minimal... if that's not going to be too much of a roadblock or a pain in the ass .. sure, that'd be awesome!

Aaron: I could definitely set up something for free! (or near free). I'll look into it üôÇ

There would have to be some communication between us in order for me to meet the requirement for my marks but nothing we couldn't do even over Skype or just email / text.
I think I have the means to come up with (at the very least) a website that looks clean and professional to display your products on. I could also probably get some version of an online shop in there too, I'd have to look at the options.
...and as far as content goes, that is something that I could provide or if you prefer, I could let you know what kind of categories I'd be working with ie. About Me, Call To Action's, etc. Either way I'm sure it'd be a fun experience for the both of us üôÇ


Heather: Cool! But wait .. I'd have to COMMUNICATE with you?? WTF, dude? Forget it then. If you're not just going to read my mind, I mean.. pfft. üòú



October 15th, 2017

Aaron: 
Hey! Sorry it took so long for me to get back to you, I've been stupid busy this last week. I could definitely whip something up. I did draw your logo yes üôÇ Digitally, with the mouse. But none the less yeah I did haha.
I can try and whip something up this week!
Also, I did some digging on the whole online store website thing, and I think we could probably get you a domain name for relatively cheap (maybe about 10 dollars?) and set you up with free hosting for about a year!
Google has this awesome thing they are doing (and I'm doing it with my website www.kanooladesign.com) where they are offering first 12 months free, but after that, I couldn't see it being any more than 5-10 dollars a month to run your website.
www.kanooladesign.com
Something you could decide when the time comes üôÇ
If that all sounds good, I could see if I could get you a domain name set up and we could square things off somehow. Like I said, probably no more than 10ish dollars to get you started for the first year.
Then you could have an online store and anything else you might want on it üôÇ
The online stores are set up via paypal, I could probably get a system in there that covers all the shipping details and stuff as well and have each order emailed to you.


Heather: 
Sounds good to me! That‚Äôs definitely reasonable, money-wise. Let me know what you need from me and I can go online and pay for stuff or send you money or whatever. Thumbs up. I‚Äôm in. Go for it. Do your thang. üòÅ



October 19th, 2017

Aaron: 
I'm about to get started creating your website and I just need some details from you:)

Heather: 
Okie doke! What would you like to know?

Aaron:
I need your desired email address using gmail ie kreacherscupboard@gmail.com, your date of birth, your desired domain name ie kreacherscupboard.com, .ca, etc. and then I'd have to send you a link to where you can purchase the domain name, or if you'd like, I can use your CC information and do it for you under whatever domain name you'd like!
First thing I need to do is create your google account or use an existing one if you have one.

Heather: 
Got one already. It IS kreacherscupboard@gmail.com

Aaron: 
That's great! Nice and clean üôÇ
I'll need to be able to log into it, and then I can give you a quote on a domain name in a few minutes. üôÇ

Heather: 
Try "**********" (without the quotes obv)
Google autocomplete password thing has ruined me. I can't remember anything anymore.

Aaron: 
Haha I feel you.
Okay! So, kreacherscupboard.com is 17 dollars per year.
and the hosting itself you should be taken care of for atleast 8-12 months.
if you decide you want to scrap it then, I can keep an eye on it and let you know when your free trial balance is running low.

Heather:
LOL. OOOhhh $17! Okie doke.. let's buy it!
Okay!

Heather:
Or rent it, I guess. Whatever. Do you want me to go fill something out?

Aaron:
Here's where I need some details haha.
Sure! You might need some form of payment handy.

Heather:
Yep.. got the CC right here.

Aaron:
https://domains.google.com
Google Domains ‚Äì Google
Search for and register a domain, get hosting, and build a site with Google Domains. The best of the internet backed by the security of Google.
domains.google
Folow this link, and click Search Domains.
type in kreacherscupboard, and it should give you a .com option with a price, and an add to cart button.
Proceed to checkout and fill out all the required fields! When you're done, you should be able to see your domain under the "My domains" tab
When you're done, there is one more thing you'll have to fill out that will need CC info, but don't worry, the only thing that you will be charged for today is the domain name. With Google's free trial, you get about 380 dollars canadian as a credit, which so far (my site has been running for a month) I've only used about 30 dollars of it.

Heather:
'Kay. Done.
It MAY be registered under my other gmail account.. I was signed in to and odd things may have happened. If you can't access the domain, let me know and I'll give you the sign in info for the other gmail account, too.

Aaron:
It's not the end of the world, I haven't tried switching email addresses on domains before, but I can't imagine it being super difficult. The only thing it will really effect is where I log in to edit the backend of your website, and where all of the emails regarding your website will go to. You can set the administrator email as kreacherscupboard@gmail.com and it will forward anyone trying to contact you through your website to that address.
Next step is to sign up for the free trial!

accounts.google.com

Heather:
The default is "individual" type account and I can't see any way to change it. Don't I need business?

Aaron:
There should be a little pencil beside that.
To change that.

Heather:
There's a pencil beside name and address, but not beside account type

Aaron:
Hmm, Odd, I'm using a testing account and I can see that here.

Heather:
Shall I just take individual and we'll see if we can switch it to business later, if necessary? (It's just that I'm at work, and I finished a couple minutes ago.. I want to go home now. üòÄ )

Aaron:
Yea! Absolutely.
I believe you might need to go with individual to access the free trial.
It's not difference really.
no*
After that we should be good to go,

Heather:
Done!

Aaron:
I think you may have signed up using your other gmail address, atleast with the domain.

Heather:
Okay, I'm all signed out of everything.. assuming I've done it all correctly, you should be all set. If you need the other account, it's heatherhorncastle@gmail.com , same password, I think, but avoid them email, please, there's work stuff in there. Confidential and all that.

Aaron:
I will, for sure. Promise.


Heather:
If you can figure out a way to switch it to the kreacher's cupboard, feel free.
I'm going to sign off and head home. I'll be online again in a bit if you need anything.

Aaron:
Okay, I might need you to send me a code that Google texts you. As it doesnt' seem to want to let me in that easily with the computer I'm on with your Heatherhorncastle@gmail.com email.

Heather:
How rude of them!

Aaron:
kreacherscupboard@gmail.com was no issue, and I think that might also be why it wasn't letting you change it to a Business haha.

Heather:
G-270186

Aaron:
perfect!
Thankyou üôÇ

Heather:
Alright. Home sweet home. Let me know if there's anything else you need.

Aaron:
Sure! üôÇ Everything is working. It's not much, but you can see something at your domain now!
http://kreacherscupboard.com/
Getting things set up is half the battle lol.

Heather:
WooI I exist!
I'm a plant, but I'm a lovely plant, so that's fine.

Aaron:
Haha üôÇ
Thank you for the opportunity for me to do this for you Heather, it's going to mean alot for my portfolio.

Heather:
Hey, you're very welcome! It's pretty awesome for me, so, thank YOU.


December 5th, 2017

Aaron:
Hey! I've done a bit more work to the website. Still just missing that about me piece. I think it looks much cleaner now, much less "commercial" feeling. More "ma and pa"''ee, if that makes sense lol. I've been working on optimizing it for mobile, still some tweaks to make though. Still a few other bugs. I think it's getting close though!

Heather:
It looks great! Here's a little something for the about me:  Kreacher‚Äôs Cupboard  came to be because I‚Äôm a bit of a geek and I don‚Äôt like crowds. 
I wanted to attend a local sci-fi (etc.) convention but I didn‚Äôt think I would enjoy walking around in the crush of people. Sitting behind a vendor table seemed like a much less anxiety-provoking way to experience the con, so I applied for a spot and got busy crafting. 
There was every possibility that the business would only exist for the two days of the convention but, several months later (is that ALL?), we‚Äôve continued to grow . 
Partway through preparation for ThunderCon, I learned how to make soap, quickly followed by lotion, bath bombs, bubble bars, lip balm, sugar scrubs and so on and so on. I still enjoy other crafts, but bath and body products have become my primary focus/obsession. 
My brilliant web designer wants me to have a mission statement.  A raison d‚Äôetre.  A motto.  SOMETHING.  Honestly? I‚Äôm drawing a blank on this one.
 I just like to make stuff. 
That‚Äôs it, really. I make things that I like, and I‚Äôve been lucky enough to find people who like the same things I do and are happy to support my craft habit. It‚Äôs worked out amazingly well.

Heather Horncastle, who typically does NOT speak about herself in the third person, lives in Northwestern Ontario with her partner of 20 years, Dave, and their 13-year old dog. She may occasionally say things like ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got a table at a craft show next week‚Äù but would like you to know that there is no ‚Äòwe‚Äô. It‚Äôs all her. All by herself. Except for when Dave builds displays and Aaron creates entire websites and Kelly teaches her how to make soap via text message and Cora drums up business..
